# Lumen Social Robot Foundation Modules

This repository contains foundation modules for Lumen Social Robot.
All modules should be self-contained, i.e. an error in one module shouldn't
affect buildability of other modules, so each team member's work progress
should be independent.

1. `persistence`. Persistence for activity journal, facts, and knowledge.
2. `social`. Social network integration, e.g. Facebook, Twitter.

[Lumen Mobile App](https://github.com/lumenitb/lumen-sdk) can be used to interact
with these modules.
